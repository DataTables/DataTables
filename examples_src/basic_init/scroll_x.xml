DataTables has the ability to show tables with horizontal scrolling, which is very useful for when you have a wide table, but want to constrain it to a limited horizontal display area. To enable x-scrolling simply set the `dt-init scrollX` parameter to be whatever you want the container wrapper's width to be (this should be 100% in almost all cases with the width being constrained by the container element).

The example below shows a table too wide for the containing element with x-scrolling enabled. The CSS option of `th, td { white-space: nowrap; }` is also set to have the text content of each row on a single line (otherwise the browser will line break the text to have it fit into the available area).
