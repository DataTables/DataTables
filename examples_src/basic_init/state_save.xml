DataTables has the option of being able to save the state of a table (its paging position, sorting state etc) so that is can be restored when the user reloads a page, or comes back to it after visiting a sub-page. This state saving ability is enabled by the `dt-init stateSave` option.

The built in state saving method uses the HTML5 `localStorage` API for efficient storage of the data. PLease note that this means that the built in state saving option will not work with IE6/7 as these browsers do not support this API. Alternative options of using cookies or saving the state on the server through Ajax can be used through the `dt-init stateSaveCallback` and `dt-init stateLoadCallback` options.

Additionally, note also that the duration for which the saved state is valid and can be used to restore the table state can be set using the `dt-init stateDuration` initialisation parameter (2 hours by default).

The example below simply shows state saving enabled in DataTables with the `dt-init saveSave` option.
